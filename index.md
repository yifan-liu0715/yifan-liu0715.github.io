## About Me

I am an MPhil graduate from Fudan University specializing in Computer Vision, 3D Reconstruction, and Neural Rendering. My research focuses on developing innovative solutions for high-fidelity 3D scene inpainting and reconstruction using adaptive Gaussian representations and semantic-aware fusion techniques. I have industry experience at Huawei Technologies and Bochu Inc., where I applied AI algorithms to solve practical problems in telecommunications and industrial inspection systems.

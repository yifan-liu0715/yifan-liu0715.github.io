# Yifan Liu (Nina) - Academic Portfolio

Welcome to my academic GitHub repository! This page serves as a portfolio of my research and projects in Computer Vision, 3D Reconstruction, and Neural Rendering.

## Research Focus

My research specializes in:
- **3D Gaussian Splatting** for real-time neural rendering
- **Generative 3D Inpainting** for scene reconstruction
- **Semantic-Aware Fusion** techniques for multi-view consistency
- **Model Optimization** for efficient neural network deployment

## Key Projects

### [Gaussian OBJ: High-Fidelity 3D Object Inpainting]
Novel framework for 3D scene inpainting using adaptive Gaussian representation and semantic-aware projection modules.

### [SAR Image Segmentation for Land-Use Planning](https://github.com/yifan-liu0715/GHY_ImageSegmentation)
Real-time semantic segmentation system deployed for Shanghai Municipal Government's remote sensing project.

### [5G Energy Efficiency Optimization](https://github.com/yifan-liu0715/ML-Learning-For-DAS-System-in-wireless-communication)
Neural network-based approach for optimizing base station configurations, reducing energy consumption by 25%.
